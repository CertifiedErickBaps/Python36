# Write a program called grade.py. Define in this program a function called grade(score) 
#that returns a string with the corresponding letter grade for a given numerical score. 
#Use the values from the following table:
#
# September 23, 2016.

    elif 70 <= score <= 84:
        return "C"

        return "B"
    elif 95 <= score <= 100:
        return "A"
