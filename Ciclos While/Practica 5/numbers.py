# Write a program called numbers.py. This program should request the user to input an arbitrary amount of 
#integer numbers. The program should stop requesting more input when the user types a zero. 
#The program should then print how many numbers were typed, and the sum and average of all those numbers 
#(without considering the zero). You do not need to define any functions other than main()
