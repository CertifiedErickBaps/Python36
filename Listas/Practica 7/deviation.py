#In statistics, the standard deviation Ïƒ is a measure of how spread out numbers are. It has the following formula:
#Where x is the arithmetic mean and is defined as follows:
#Write a program called deviation.py. Define in this program a function called deviation(x) that returns the standard deviation of the list of numbers contained in x.
